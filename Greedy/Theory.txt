Greedy works only when the problem has:
-> Greedy Choice Property
-> Optimal Substructure

You don’t need to formally prove these in interviews — but you must recognize patterns.

2. 🔑 Keywords That SUGGEST Greedy

Whenever you see these words, Greedy should ring a bell:

Keyword / Phrase	Why it hints Greedy
Maximum / Minimum	- Optimization
Least / Most	- Choose best option
As early as possible	- Sort + pick
As late as possible	- Sort + pick
Non-overlapping	- Interval problems
Schedule / Meetings	Interval - Scheduling
Fraction allowed	- Fractional Knapsack
Remove minimum	- Choose best removal
Reach end -	Jump strategy
Shortest / longest	- Local best choice


============================================================================================================================================

1) Pattern 1 :- Interval Scheduling / Non-overlapping 
Goal - 👉 Select the maximum number of intervals such that no two overlap.

Ask this question:
“Which meeting should I attend first so that I get the maximum remaining time for future meetings?”

Answer:
➡️ The meeting that finishes earliest

The Exact Greedy Rule (Memorize This)
Sort all intervals by end time
Always pick the interval whose start ≥ last selected end
